Ensuring that public access to a system component is specifically authorized reduces the risk of system components being unnecessarily exposed to untrusted networks.

Good Practice
System components that provide publicly accessible services, such as email, web, and DNS servers, are the most vulnerable to threats originating from untrusted networks. Ideally, such systems are placed within a dedicated trusted network that is public facing (for example, a DMZ) but that is separated via NSCs from more sensitive internal systems, which helps protect the rest of the network in the event these externally accessible systems are compromised.

Systems containing a combination of services, protocols, and daemons for their primary function will have a security profile appropriate to allow that function to operate effectively.

• A process for verifying, at least once every three months, that stored account data exceeding the defined retention period has been securely deleted or rendered unrecoverable.","Purpose
A formal data retention policy identifies what data needs to be retained, for how long, and where that data resides so it can be securely destroyed or deleted as soon as it is no longer needed. The only account data that may be stored after authorization is the primary account number or PAN (rendered unreadable), expiration date, cardholder name, and service code.

Good Practice
When identifying locations of stored account data, consider all processes and personnel with access to the data, as data could have been moved and stored in different locations than originally defined. Storage locations that are often overlooked include backup and archive systems, removable data storage devices, paper-based media, and audio recordings. To define appropriate retention requirements, an entity first needs to understand its own business needs as well as any legal or regulatory obligations that apply to its industry or to the type of data being retained.

Methods of eliminating data when it exceeds the retention period include secure deletion to complete removal of the data or rendering it unrecoverable and unable to be reconstructed. Identifying and securely eliminating stored data that has exceeded its specified retention period prevents unnecessary retention of data that is no longer needed. This process may be automated, manual, or a combination of both.

Applying access controls according to defined roles is one way to limit access to viewing full PAN to only those individuals with a defined business need. The masking approach should always display only the number of digits needed to perform a specific business function. For example, if only the last four digits are needed to perform a business function, PAN should be masked to only show the last four digits. As another example, if a function needs to view to the bank identification number (BIN) for routing purposes, unmask only the BIN digits for that function.

Definitions
The display of full PAN on computer screens, payment card receipts, paper reports, etc. can result in this data being obtained by unauthorized individuals and used fraudulently.

This requirement relates to protection of PAN where it is displayed on screens, paper receipts, printouts, etc., and is not to be confused with Requirement 3.5.1 for protection of PAN when stored, processed, or transmitted.","a.

• A list of roles that need access to more than the BIN and last four digits of the PAN (includes full PAN) is documented, together with a legitimate business need for each role to have such access.
• PAN is masked when displayed such that only personnel with a legitimate business need can see more than the BIN and last four digits of the PAN.
• All roles not specifically authorized to see the full PAN must only see masked PANs.

• Job classification and function.
• Least privileges necessary to perform job responsibilities.","Purpose
Assigning least privileges helps prevent users without sufficient knowledge about the application from incorrectly or accidentally changing application configuration or altering its security settings. Enforcing least privilege also helps to minimize the scope of damage if an unauthorized person gains access to a user ID.

Good Practice
Access rights are granted to a user by assignment to one or several functions. Assess is assigned depending on the specific user functions and with the minimum scope required for the job. When assigning privileged access, it is important to assign individuals only the privileges they need to perform their job (the “least privileges”). For example, the database administrator or backup administrator should not be assigned the same privileges as the overall systems administrator. Once needs are defined for user functions (per PCI DSS requirement 7.2.1), it is easy to grant individuals access according to their job classification and function by using the already- created roles. Entities may wish to consider use of Privileged Access Management (PAM), which is a method to grant access to privileged accounts only when those privileges are required, immediately revoking that access once they are no longer needed.

Unauthorizedwireless devices could be hidden within orattached to a computer or other systemcomponent. These devices could also beattached directly to a network port, to a networkdevice such as a switch or router, or inserted as awireless interface card inside a systemcomponent.If a wireless device or network is installed withouta company’s knowledge, it can allow an attackerto enter the network easily and “invisibly.”Detecting and removing such unauthorizedaccess points reduces the duration and likelihoodof such devices being leveraged for an attack.

Good Practice
The size and complexity of an environment will dictate the appropriate tools and processes to be used to provide sufficient assurance that a rogue wireless access point has not been installed in the environment. For example, performing a detailed physicalinspection of a single stand-alone retail kiosk in ashopping mall, where all communicationcomponents are contained within tamper-resistantand tamper-evident casings, may be sufficient toprovide assurance that a rogue wireless accesspoint has not been attached or installed.However, in an environment with multiple nodes(such as in a large retail store, call center, serverroom or data center), detailed physical inspectioncan be difficult.

A penetration test differs from a vulnerability scan, as a penetration test is an active process that usually includes exploiting identified vulnerabilities. Scanning for vulnerabilities alone is not a penetration test, nor is a penetration test adequate if the focus is solely on trying to exploit vulnerabilities found in a vulnerability scan. Conducting a vulnerability scan may be one of the first steps, but it is not the only step a penetration tester will perform to plan the testing strategy. Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will often gain enough knowledge about the system to identify possible security gaps. Penetration testing is a highly manual process. While some automated tools may be used, the tester uses their knowledge of systems to gain access into an environment. Often the tester will chain several types of exploits together with the goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For example, if the tester finds a way to gain access to an application server, the tester will then use the compromised server as a point to stage a new attack based on the resources to which the server has access. In this way, a tester can simulate the techniques used by an attacker to identify areas of potential weakness in the environment. The testing of security monitoring and detection methods—for example, to confirm the effectiveness of logging and file integrity monitoring mechanisms, should also be considered.",Refer to the Information Supplement: Penetration Testing Guidance for additional guidance.

PCI Data Security Standard v4.0,PCI DSS v4.0 - 11.4.2,PCI Data Security Standard v4.0 - 11.4.2,"Internal penetration testing is performed:
• Per the entity’s defined methodology,
• At least once every 12 months
• After any significant infrastructure or application upgrade or change
• By a qualified internal resource or qualified external third-party
• Organizational independence of the tester exists (not required to be a QSA or ASV).","Purpose
Internal penetration testing serves two purposes. Firstly, just like an external penetration test, it discovers vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that could be used by an attacker that had managed to get some degree of access to the internal network, whether that is because the attacker is an authorized user conducting unauthorized activities, or an external attacker that had managed to penetrate the entity’s perimeter. Secondly, internal penetration testing also helps entities to discover where their change control process failed by detecting previously unknown systems. Additionally, it verifies the status of many of the controls operating within the CDE. A penetration test is not truly a “test” because the outcome of a penetration test is not something that can be classified as a “pass” or a “fail.” The best outcome of a test is a catalog of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that an entity did not know about and the penetration tester found them before an attacker could. A penetration test that found nothing is typically indicative of shortcomings of the penetration tester, rather than being a positive reflection of the security posture of the entity.

Good Practice
Some considerations when choosing a qualified resource to perform penetration testing include:
• Specific penetration testing certifications, which may be an indication of the tester’s skilllevel and competence.
• Prior experience conducting penetration testing—for example, the number of years of experience, and the type and scope of prior engagements can help confirm whether the tester’s experience is appropriate for the needs of the engagement.

Detecting covert malware communication attempts (for example, DNS tunneling) can help block the spread of malware laterally inside a network and the exfiltration of data. When deciding where to place this control, entities should consider critical locations in the network, and likely routes for covert channels. When malware establishes a foothold in an infected environment, it often tries to establish a communication channel to a command-and- control (C&C) server. Through the C&C server, the attacker communicates with and controls malware on compromised systems to deliver malicious payloads or instructions, or to initiate data exfiltration. In many cases, the malware will communicate with the C&C server indirectly via botnets, bypassing monitoring, blocking controls, and rendering these methods ineffective to detect the covert channels.

Good Practice

• Review of each targeted risk analysis at least once every 12 months to determine whether the results are still valid or if an updated risk analysis is needed.
• Performance of updated risk analyses when needed, as determined by the annual review.","Purpose
Some PCI DSS requirements allow an entity to define how frequently an activity is performed based on the risk to environment. Performing this risk analysis according to a methodology ensures validity and consistency with policies and procedures. This targeted risk analysis (as opposed to a traditional enterprise-wide risk assessment) focuses on those PCI DSS requirements that allow an entity flexibility about how frequently an entity performs a given control. For this risk analysis, the entity carefully evaluates each PCI DSS requirement that provides this flexibility and determines the frequency that supports adequate security for the entity, and the level of risk the entity is willing to accept. The risk analysis identifies the specific assets, such as the system components and data—for example, log files, or credentials—that the requirement is intended to protect, as well as the threat(s) or outcomes that the requirement is protecting the assets from—for example, malware, an undetected intruder, or misuse of credentials. Examples of factors that could contribute to likelihood or impact include any that could increase the vulnerability of an asset to a threat—for example, exposure to untrusted networks, complexity of environment, or high staff turnover—as well as the criticality of the system components, or volume and sensitivity of the data, being protected. Reviewing the results of these targeted risk analyses at least once every 12 months and upon changes that could impact the risk to the environment allows the organization to ensure the risk analysis results remain current with organizational changes and evolving threats, trends, and technologies, and that the selected frequencies still adequately address the entity’s risk.

Frequent validation of PCI DSS scope helps to ensure PCI DSS scope remains up to date and aligned with changing business objectives, and therefore that security controls are protecting all appropriate system components.

Good Practice
Accurate scoping involves critically evaluating the CDE and all connected system components to determine the necessary coverage for PCI DSS requirements. Scoping activities, including careful analysis and ongoing monitoring, help to ensure that in-scope systems are appropriately secured. When documenting account data locations, the entity can consider creating a table or spreadsheet that includes the following information:
• Data stores (databases, files, cloud, etc.), including the purpose of data storage and the retention period,
• Which CHD elements are stored (PAN, expiry date, cardholder name, and/or any elements of SAD prior to completion of authorization),
• How data is secured (type of encryption and strength, hashing algorithm and strength, truncation, tokenization),
• How access to data stores is logged, including a description of logging mechanism(s) in use (enterprise solution, application level, operating system level, etc.).
In addition to internal systems and networks, all connections from third-party entities—for example, business partners, entities providing remote support services, and other service providers—need to be identified to determine inclusion for PCI DSS scope. Once the in-scope connections have been identified, the applicable PCI DSS controls can be implemented to reduce the risk of a third-party connection being used to compromise an entity’s CDE. A data discovery tool or methodology can be used to facilitate identifying all sources and locations of PAN, and to look for PAN that resides on systems and networks outside the currently defined CDE or in unexpected places within the defined CDE— for example, in an error log or memory dump file.

Knowing the PCI DSS compliance status of all engaged TPSPs provides assurance and awareness about whether they comply with the requirements applicable to the services they offer to the organization.

Good Practice
If the TPSP offers a variety of services, the compliance status the entity monitors should be specific to those services delivered to the entity and those services in scope for the entity’s PCI DSS assessment. If a TPSP has a PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AOC), the expectation is that the TPSP should provide that to customers upon request to demonstrate their PCI DSS compliance status. If the TPSP did not undergo a PCI DSS assessment, it may be able to provide other sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it has met the applicable requirements without undergoing a formal compliance validation. For example, the TPSP can provide specific evidence to the entity’s assessor so the assessor can confirm applicable requirements are met. Alternatively, the TPSP can elect to undergo multiple on-demand assessments by each of its customers’ assessors, with each assessment targeted to confirm that applicable requirements are met.

Good Practice
Entities can document these responsibilities via a matrix that identifies all applicable PCI DSS requirements and indicates for each requirement whether the entity or TPSP is responsible for meeting that requirement or whether it is a shared responsibility.

PCI DSS Reference: Scope of PCI DSS Requirements, Requirement 12.","Purpose
Frequent validation of PCI DSS scope helps to ensure PCI DSS scope remains up to date and aligned with changing business objectives, and therefore that security controls are protecting all appropriate system components.

Good Practice
Accurate scoping involves critically evaluating the CDE and all connected system components to determine the necessary coverage for PCI DSS requirements. Scoping activities, including careful analysis and ongoing monitoring, help to ensure that in-scope systems are appropriately secured. When documenting account data locations, the entity can consider creating a table or spreadsheet that includes the following information:
• Data stores (databases, files, cloud, etc.), including purpose of data storage and the retention period,
• Which CHD elements are stored (PAN, expiry date, cardholder name, and/or any elements of SAD prior to completion of authorization),
• How data is secured (type of encryption and strength, hashing algorithm and strength, truncation, tokenization),
• How access to data stores is logged, including a description of logging mechanism(s) in use (enterprise solution, application level, operating system level, etc.).
In addition to internal systems and networks, all connections from third-party entities—for example, business partners, entities providing remote support services, and other service providers—need to be identified to determine inclusion for PCI DSS scope. Once the in-scope connections have been identified, the applicable PCI DSS controls can be implemented to reduce the risk of a third-party connection being used to compromise an entity’s CDE. A data discovery tool or methodology can be used to facilitate identifying all sources and locations of PAN, and to look for PAN that resides on systems and networks outside the currently defined CDE or in unexpected places within the defined CDE— for example, in an error log or memory dump file. This approach can help ensure that previously unknown locations of PAN are detected and that the PAN is either eliminated or properly secured.
