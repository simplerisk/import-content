•  Truncation (hashing cannot be used to replace the truncated segment of PAN)
•  Index tokens and pads (pads must be securely stored)
•  Strong cryptography with associated key-management processes and procedures.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity’s environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN.","PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected.

One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of precomputed hash values.

The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored.

An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key.

The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or ""homegrown"" algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys.

Public-facing web applications are also subject to additional controls, to address ongoing threats and vulnerabilities after implementation, as defined at PCI DSS Requirement 6.6.","Security vulnerabilities in custom code are commonly exploited by malicious individuals to gain access to a network and compromise cardholder data.

An individual knowledgeable and experienced in code-review techniques should be involved in the review process. Code reviews should be performed by someone other than the developer of the code to allow for an independent, objective review. Automated tools or processes may also be used in lieu of manual reviews, but keep in mind that it may be difficult or even impossible for an automated tool to identify some coding issues.

Correcting coding errors before the code is deployed into a production environment or released to customers prevents the code exposing the environments to potential exploit. Faulty code is also far more difficult and expensive to address after it has been deployed or released into production environments.

Including a formal review and signoff by management prior to release helps to ensure that code is approved and has been developed in accordance with policies and procedures.",6.3.2,Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program,Requirement 6: Develop and maintain secure systems and applications

Note: Examples of signs that a device might have been tampered with or substituted include unexpected attachments or cables plugged into the device, missing or changed security labels, broken or differently colored casing, or changes to the serial number or other external markings.","Regular inspections of devices will help organizations to more quickly detect tampering or replacement of a device, and thereby minimize the potential impact of using fraudulent devices.

The type of inspection will depend on the device— for example, photographs of devices that are known to be secure can be used to compare a device’s current appearance with its original appearance to see whether it has changed. Another option may be to use a secure marker pen, such as a UV light marker, to mark device surfaces and device openings so any tampering or replacement will be apparent. Criminals will often replace the outer casing of a device to hide their tampering, and these methods may help to detect such activities. Device vendors may also be able to provide security guidance and “how to” guides to help determine whether the device has been tampered with.

The frequency of inspections will depend on factors such as location of device and whether the device is attended or unattended. For example, devices left in public areas without supervision by the organization’s personnel may have more frequent inspections than devices that are kept in secure areas or are supervised when they are accessible to the public.

•  Do not install, replace, or return devices without verification.
•  Be aware of suspicious behavior around devices (for example, attempts by unknown persons to unplug or open devices).
•  Report suspicious behavior and indications of device tampering or substitution to appropriate personnel (for example, to a manager or security officer).","Criminals will often pose as authorized maintenance personnel in order to gain access to POS devices. All third parties requesting access to devices should always be verified before being provided access—for example, by checking with management or phoning the POS maintenance company (such as the vendor or acquirer) for verification. Many criminals will try to fool personnel by dressing for the part (for example, carrying toolboxes and dressed in work wear), and could also be knowledgeable about locations of devices, so it’s important personnel are trained to follow procedures at all times.

Another trick criminals like to use is to send a “new” POS system with instructions for swapping it with a legitimate system and “returning” the legitimate system to a specified address.

Due to the ease with which a wireless access point can be attached to a network, the difficulty in detecting their presence, and the increased risk presented by unauthorized wireless devices, these processes must be performed even when a policy exists prohibiting the use of wireless technology.

Note: Multiple scan reports can be combined for the quarterly scan process to show that all systems were scanned and all applicable vulnerabilities have been addressed. Additional documentation may be required to verify non-remediated vulnerabilities are in the process of being addressed. 

For initial PCI DSS compliance, it is not required that four quarters of passing scans be completed if the assessor verifies 1) the most recent scan result was a passing scan, 2) the entity has documented policies and procedures requiring quarterly scanning, and 3) vulnerabilities noted in the scan results have been corrected as shown in a re-scan(s). For subsequent years after the initial PCI DSS review, four quarters of passing scans must have occurred.","A vulnerability scan is a combination of automated or manual tools, techniques, and/or methods run against external and internal network devices and servers, designed to expose potential vulnerabilities that could be found and exploited by malicious individuals.

There are three types of vulnerability scanning required for PCI DSS:

• Internal quarterly vulnerability scanning by qualified personnel (use of a PCI SSC Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) is not required)

• External quarterly vulnerability scanning, which must be performed by an ASV

• Internal and external scanning as needed after significant changes

Once these weaknesses are identified, the entity corrects them and repeats the scan until all vulnerabilities have been corrected.

•  Includes coverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems
•  Includes testing from both inside and outside the network
•  Includes testing to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls
•  Defines application-layer penetration tests to include, at a minimum, the vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.5
•  Defines network-layer penetration tests to include components that support network functions as well as operating systems
•  Includes review and consideration of threats and vulnerabilities experienced in the last 12 months
•  Specifies retention of penetration testing results and remediation activities results.","The intent of a penetration test is to simulate a real-world attack situation with a goal of identifying how far an attacker would be able to penetrate into an environment. This allows an entity to gain a better understanding of their potential exposure and develop a strategy to defend against attacks.

A penetration test differs from a vulnerability scan, as a penetration test is an active process that may include exploiting identified vulnerabilities. Conducting a vulnerability scan may be one of the first steps a penetration tester will perform in order to plan the testing strategy, although it is not the only step. Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will often gain enough knowledge about the system to identify possible security gaps.

Penetration testing is generally a highly manual process. While some automated tools may be used, the tester uses their knowledge of systems to penetrate into an environment. Often the tester will chain several types of exploits together with a goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For example, if the tester finds a means to gain access to an application server, they will then use the compromised server as a point to stage a new attack based on the resources the server has access to. In this way, a tester is able to simulate the methods performed by an attacker to identify areas of potential weakness in the environment.",11.3,Regularly Monitor and Test Networks,Requirement 11: Regularly test security systems and processes
